            <p>Welcome to <strong>Nekonomy</strong>. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
                the Nekonomy mobile application and related services (the "App") provided by Dante Rivarola Dinatale
                ("we", "our", or "us"). By downloading, installing, or using the App you agree to these Terms.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>1. Developer & Contact</h2>
        <p>Developer: <strong>Dante Rivarola Dinatale</strong><br />
            Website / Support: <a href="https://dantelo.dev/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dantelo.dev/</a></p>

        <h2>2. Subscriptions — Pro plan</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Subscription at a glance:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan name: <strong>Pro plan</strong></li>
                <li>Price: <strong>USD $4.99 per month</strong></li>
                <li>Type: <strong>Auto-renewable monthly subscription</strong></li>
                <li>Free trial: <strong>None</strong></li>
                <li>Features unlocked: unlimited reports, unlimited categories, unlimited currencies, and individual
                    currency manipulation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Subscriptions are billed through the user's Apple ID account and will be charged to that account. Your
            subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless auto-renew is turned off at
            least 24 hours before the end of the current period. The account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours
            prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription any time via your Apple
            ID subscription settings.</p>

        <h2>3. Payments, Refunds, and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>All payments are processed by Apple via the App Store. We do not directly handle payment information. Refunds
            are handled by Apple; if you wish to request a refund, please contact Apple Support or use the Report a
            Problem system. Cancelling your subscription will stop future auto-renewals but will not result in a refund
            for the current billing period unless otherwise required by law or granted by Apple.</p>

        <h2>4. What the subscription unlocks</h2>
        <p>While an active Pro plan subscription is in effect, you will have access to the features listed above. If
            your subscription lapses or is cancelled, access to those premium features will be removed according to the
            App's behavior at that time.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Collection & Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We collect information necessary to operate the App — such as account details and usage analytics — and to
            provide the subscription service. By using the App you consent to such collection and processing in
            accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
